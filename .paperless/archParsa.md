# Google Cloud Development Platform for Paperless

## Project Overview

> Cloud Architect : Parsaloi Nakuoh alias archParsa

archParsa set up the Kubernetes platform to simplify the development to production transition for the Paperless developers.

The Paperless developers will transition to developing and testing prototypes in a Google Cloud environment on a Kubernetes cluster.  
The GKE cluster (Google Kubernetes Engine) is comprised of one zonal cluster that is configured to host a minimum of 3 development nodes and a maximum of  
9 development nodes as well as the in built autoscaling feature for nodes enabled.

## Developer experience

This Cloud-native enviroment will enable Paperless developers to focus on writing code that is important to their solution which is creating highly available teacher assistant  
tools that will increse the productivity of a teacher whose main job is to nurture her students.  

This development platform on Google Cloud will also enable the Paperless developers to leverage Google APIs in application development which will accelerate the continous integration  
and continous deployment of teaching assistant tools for their customers.
