This is a mini-projects series demonstrating my GCP Cloud Architect journey

## Introduction

Navigating the landscape of Cloud Computing and Cloud-native Architectures is a continous exciting journey and Cloud Platforms such as the Google Cloud Platform have been a ***great co-pilot***.  
Learning Kuberenets concepts from the Kubernetes docs <https://kubernetes.io/> has been a beautiful experince thus far. I am a proud member of the online K8s open-source community where we share and learn  
cool stuff.
